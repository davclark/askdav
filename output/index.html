        <div class="e-content">
        <div><p>In the early 70’s, Steve Paxton’s embarked on an series of experiments with
physicality that he said was missing from dance at the time. He was inspired in
particular by the martial arts. Steve submitted a grant proposal to the NEA, who
proceeded to fund these experiments – initially a small group of athletic men
literally throwing themselves at each other to see what could happen. If you
manage to see some footage of these first experiments, it looks pretty nuts, and
it was – the first participants couldn’t keep up this level of intensity, and
they toned things down rapidly after the first couple of weeks! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FeSDsmIeHA#t=2m42s">This
video</a> shows some of the
preparation for their first performance. You can see there that women had
already been included, and – while it may be much harder to see – there’s a
clear focus on safety.</p>
<p>From those initial experiments, Contact Improv has become a true folk art, and
it’s now under continuing development (somewhat anarchically) by the community
that practices it.  There is no appreciable culture of critics, and no real
audience to speak of (though some claim it is the “largest” influence on where
contemporary dance has gone in recent times). One particular point of contention
is embodied by Steve Paxton’s assertion that “If you’re dancing physics, you’re
dancing contact. if you’re dancing chemistry, you’re doing something else.” But
this debate is an aspirational one at best – any interaction between two human
bodies will involve both physics and the emotional stuff that comes up.</p>
<p>If you know me, it’s likely no surprise that my initial experience of Contact
<em>was</em> pretty much “dancing physics” – I <em>get</em> this attitude, and I think this
physics-oriented attitude is a great place to focus on developing the skills you
need to stay safe and have fun. I had come from a longish history of practicing
things like juggling and acro-balance. And I <em>like</em> physics. But I’ve been
dancing long enough to come to know folks for whom Contact Improv (or any dance)
is profoundly emotional, social, or even “sexual” in some sense. This view is
well-represented in the community, and the variety of attitudes is generally not
a problem – in the end, the reality of two or more people dancing simply is
what it is. An important aspect of that is negotiating with partners to have the
kinds of dances that you want. But no matter what you think Contact Improv is
“about,” it’s easy to see that there are issues surrounding both physical and
emotional safety in the context of the dance – particularly when you’re dancing
with people you don’t know very well.</p>
<p>I was one of the organizers of Camp Contact one year, and I had conversations
with my friends who ran successful jams to get tips on how to help make it a
great experience for everyone involved. I got a surprising bit of advice from a
friend who runs the Open Movement Jam in New York – he gave me tips on how to
identify sexual predators and suggested I interrupt certain kinds of movement
interactions.  He was not simply imagining things – he told me how he’d
recently had to ask one attendee of the jam to leave, and that later this man
did commit an act of sexual abuse at another dance event in the city.</p>
<p>So, going into running the camp, I was on alert and doing everything I could to
encourage our members to look out for each other. In spite of this effort, there
was an act of sexual abuse at the very first jam at Camp Contact. This was a
tragedy, and I realized that whether I “try hard” or not, abuse can still happen
– it takes more than just words. So, I became engaged in the community to build
awareness and a more distributed defense against this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Some time later, a couple was visiting me from Naropa University. I was
experiencing a great connection in particular with one of them about social
structures that support meditation and positive action. Her partner and I are
huge Contact Improv enthusiasts, and we both really wanted her to be able to
share in our experience. She resisted coming to a jam with us, however, because
of an experience she’d had previously with sexual predation in a similar dance
setting. But, we convinced her to join us. And, to my shock and subsequent
outrage, it happened to her again.</p>
<p>A colleague overstated my feelings <em>only slightly</em> when I told him about this
incident. He guessed I must have “wanted to rip somebody’s balls off.”
Certainly, I wanted to confront the guy. But the victim of this assault didn’t
even want to tell me who it was – she wanted to handle it on her own. My
“taking control” of the situation would simply have been another aggressive male
taking actions that weren’t supportive of her wishes. In short order, we all
calmed down a bit, and she had a talk with the organizer of that particular jam
– also a woman. The organizer had a talk with the man who committed the assault
– a newcomer – and he seemed to understand that he needed to change his
behavior in the jam.</p>
<p>This was an even more profound and important lesson. The wishes of the victims
of abuse are what matter. Through my imperfect capacity for empathy, I’ll have
my own emotional reactions and my own wishes. But, I need to check in with the
wishes of the victim, and support them in determining the resolution that is
best for them.</p>
<p>But it’s not simple to follow this principle. An individual may have
difficulty “determining their wishes” given the psychological shock of an abuse.
And as a society we may need to prevent an abuser from being able to commit
further acts of abuse. But whatever policies we adopt, it can still be done with
an orientation towards the wishes of victims, both actual and potential.</p></div>

        <div><h4>What's this about?</h4>
<p>This post is largely my own "kicking the tires" on
<a href="http://getnikola.com">Nikola</a>. The important information from this post should
make its way to an about page or a sidebar.</p>
<p>I currently work in the <a href="http://dlab.berkeley.edu">D-Lab</a>, with a strong focus
on public-facing science. Notably, I'm working with <a href="http://oroeco.com">Oroeco</a>
and others on climate and behavior, and generally interested in science with
social impacts, currently focused on <a href="http://statsforchange.com">Stats for
Change</a> (a Bay Area hub) and the <a href="http://dssg.io">Data Science for
Social Good Fellows Program</a>. I'm also interested in the role of
personal development, ranging from education to "mindful practice" (like
meditation, taiji, the Feldenkrais Method®, and Contact Improv).</p>
<p>This design of this site is meant to support &amp; cross-reference that work!</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<h4>Why Nikola? (And what's my recipe?)</h4>
<p><a href="http://getnikola.com">Nikola</a> and <a href="http://blog.getpelican.com">Pelican</a> are the
heavy contenders in python static site generation. Both currently support
IPython notebooks as sources for rendered pages, which is rad. Pelican requires
the use of one of
<a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/liquid_tags">two</a>
<a href="https://github.com/danielfrg/pelican-ipythonnb">plugins</a>, and while there is a
plugin on GitHub for Nikola, the current version has been moved into the core
(and the author <a href="https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/issues/824">intends to keep it
there</a>).</p>
<p>I'm interested in seeing how far we can abuse the static approach to avoid
reliance on application servers.  As such, the availability of
<a href="http://www.makotemplates.org/">Mako</a> in Nikola gives me the full power of
Python right there in my templates, and doesn't require me to learn much
about Nikola's build process to do so (except that I know my Mako templates will
run).</p>
<h5>The recipe</h5>
<p>I'm still up in the air about using <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda</a>
for stuff like this (instead of a virtualenv), but that's what I did. In case
you're wondering, "Problems with Anaconda" (which are obviously not
deal-breakers!) include:</p>
<ol>
<li>the fact that it does not automatically install pip in a new environment, as
    virtualenv does, which leads to confusion when installing packages,</li>
<li>the fact that if you do things the simple way (i.e., just give conda a list
    of packages you want), it won't necessarily do the smart thing anyway and
    get the binary versions, and</li>
<li>to my knowledge the free edition doesn't compile numerics against
    Accelerate.framework (or OpenBLAS) on OS X (not a big issue if you're an
    academic / can afford the confusingly named continuum Accelerate package
    that includes MKL). This last point shouldn't matter much at all here!</li>
</ol>
<p>Anaconda, contrary to popular conceptions, works out of the box without
registration, and is <a href="http://continuum.io/blog/anaconda-1-4-released">freely redistributable since version
1.4</a>.</p>
<p>Since I use Anaconda alot, I was actually able to mostly guess correctly which
dependencies are available in anaconda, so the way I set up my environment is
like so:</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span class="n">conda</span> <span class="n">create</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="n">askdav</span> <span class="n">ipython</span> <span class="n">pip</span> <span class="n">requests</span> <span class="n">markdown</span> <span class="n">pillow</span> <span class="n">pygments</span> <span class="n">docutils</span> <span class="n">lxml</span> <span class="n">pytz</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After that, you should be GTG with a simple <code>conda install nikola</code>. Recent
versions of <code>conda</code> will automatically invoke <code>pip</code> if the binary package is
unavailable.</p></div>
