Starting to talk about Feldenkrais
----------------------------------

A CS professor wrote some stuff:

- http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arora/feldenkrais.html
- http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arora/RSI.html

There are also some articles that I should refer to:

- Maybe: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11097-016-9469-8
- http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01424/full

Movies for conversations
------------------------

Pull in stuff I wrote for ecult about lost in translation and matchstick men

zootopia about discrimination abstracted from the American situation

When Marnie was There - about adoption, difficult childhood

Spirited Away - about another perspective on WWII, and what it means for a real
person to be centrally involved in waging a war


Books for serious contemplation
-------------------------------

Wind up bird Chronicle for another view on WWII from the Japanese perspective

Home audio recording
--------------------

Started violating my principles, using the cheapest thing I could fine - a
Behringer Uphoria-UM2 which is like $30!

The Behringer Uphoria-UMC204HD is a nice step-up to $80, but back-ordered, and
sound quality is likely sub-par

Looks Like the Mackie Onyx is the way to go, in part because I'm using a
dynamic mic (Shure SM58) and it has 60dB of amplification, < 0.002% THD+N. Only
~$100.

### Others in the running

available for ~$129, 2i4 is ~$179 has nicer noise?.

Ideas on audio processing
-------------------------

Maybe normalize the audio (to 0dB for loud stuff or eventually to -12dB for
speech audio), then sample hiss, then reduce with noise reduction system
