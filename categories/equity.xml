physicality that he said was missing from dance at the time. He was inspired in
particular by the martial arts. Steve submitted a grant proposal to the NEA, who
proceeded to fund these experiments – initially a small group of athletic men
literally throwing themselves at each other to see what could happen. If you
manage to see some footage of these first experiments, it looks pretty nuts, and
it was – the first participants couldn’t keep up this level of intensity, and
they toned things down rapidly after the first couple of weeks! &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FeSDsmIeHA#t=2m42s"&gt;This
video&lt;/a&gt; shows some of the
preparation for their first performance. You can see there that women had
already been included, and – while it may be much harder to see – there’s a
clear focus on safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From those initial experiments, Contact Improv has become a true folk art, and
it’s now under continuing development (somewhat anarchically) by the community
that practices it.  There is no appreciable culture of critics, and no real
audience to speak of (though some claim it is the “largest” influence on where
contemporary dance has gone in recent times). One particular point of contention
is embodied by Steve Paxton’s assertion that “If you’re dancing physics, you’re
dancing contact. if you’re dancing chemistry, you’re doing something else.” But
this debate is an aspirational one at best – any interaction between two human
bodies will involve both physics and the emotional stuff that comes up.&lt;/p&gt;
