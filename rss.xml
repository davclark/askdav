that Changes Itself” by Norman Doidge. It’s really inspiring. But, I always
caution people not to get seduced by the seemingly “scientific” nature of
brain-based research - research at the psychological or social level is just as
valid!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, continuing with a more cognitive neuroscience approach, Sylvia Bunge
(also at Berkeley) has a great program on helping low-economic-staus /
low-performing kids boost their cognitive abilities. Read more at her public
&lt;a href="http://bungelab.berkeley.edu/nora-the-brain-explorer/"&gt;Nora the Brain Explorer
site&lt;/a&gt;. She has a nice
metaphor - if you have plants with a certain potential, but don’t water them,
they will be stunted. But happilly, it seems that kids can return closer to
their potential even if they get “water” late. She’s also written a nice review
of &lt;a href="http://www.dana.org/Cerebrum/2013/Review__How_Children_Succeed__Grit,_Curiosity,_and_the_Hidden_Power_of_Character/"&gt;Paul Tough’s
book&lt;/a&gt;,
which provides a nice connection between Tough’s more social description, and a
cognitive/neural level of description – including some clarification and
critique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adele Diamond is another reesarcher I respect very much, and she emphasizes the
importance of exercise and play on her &lt;a href="http://www.devcogneuro.com/"&gt;public
site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Silvia and Adele focus on “executive function” - which is a cognitive-level
description of some of the core features that I think are relative to “Grit”
(though I still need to read up on that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of my own work, the best, most accessible summary is not actually
published, but it’ll probably be published soon. (If not, there’s other stuff I
can point you to if you need a published reference.) But the basic idea is that
you can indeed change people’s minds about climate change with education (even
though some say it’s “culturally determined”). I’ve attached that - please don’t
share it too widely, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I also love Ellen Langer’s work (hmm… all female scientists). She has
a very accessible book called “Mindfulness” that talks about changing people’s
mindsets in a variety of ways. In some cases, adding years to life! But more
relevant to education or tutoring, improving a child’s ability to reason
effectively in more academic settings. To be clear, her notion of mindfulness is
a little more general than meditative notions - and is better thought of (I
think) as “not mindlessness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://askdav.com/posts/resources-on-the-ability-to-learn.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2015 19:42:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Practicing Inhibition and Selection</title><link>http://askdav.com/posts/practicing-inhibition-and-selection.html</link><dc:creator>@davclark</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://askdav.com/donut.svg" style="width: 200px; max-width: 100%; height: auto; float: right" alt="A perception, a thought, an action..."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking an interest in the materials I presented at ISCS 2014. I’m
excited to collaborate with you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be producing a recorded intervention in the coming week or so, but I still
need to square things aware with our IRB! In the meantime, please leave a
comment on &lt;a href="https://osf.io/btc5f/"&gt;the Open Science Framework (OSF) project&lt;/a&gt;
(you’ll need to make an account, then after you log in and visit my project,
there’ll be a blue speech bubble icon on the right), or just email me at
davclark@berkeley.edu to be kept in the loop.&lt;/p&gt;

physicality that he said was missing from dance at the time. He was inspired in
particular by the martial arts. Steve submitted a grant proposal to the NEA, who
proceeded to fund these experiments – initially a small group of athletic men
literally throwing themselves at each other to see what could happen. If you
manage to see some footage of these first experiments, it looks pretty nuts, and
it was – the first participants couldn’t keep up this level of intensity, and
they toned things down rapidly after the first couple of weeks! &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FeSDsmIeHA#t=2m42s"&gt;This
video&lt;/a&gt; shows some of the
preparation for their first performance. You can see there that women had
already been included, and – while it may be much harder to see – there’s a
clear focus on safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From those initial experiments, Contact Improv has become a true folk art, and
it’s now under continuing development (somewhat anarchically) by the community
that practices it.  There is no appreciable culture of critics, and no real
audience to speak of (though some claim it is the “largest” influence on where
contemporary dance has gone in recent times). One particular point of contention
is embodied by Steve Paxton’s assertion that “If you’re dancing physics, you’re
dancing contact. if you’re dancing chemistry, you’re doing something else.” But
this debate is an aspirational one at best – any interaction between two human
bodies will involve both physics and the emotional stuff that comes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is largely my own “kicking the tires” on&lt;a href="http://getnikola.com"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;. The important information from this post should
make its way to an about page or a sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently work in the &lt;a href="http://dlab.berkeley.edu"&gt;D-Lab&lt;/a&gt;, with a strong focus
on public-facing science. Notably, I’m working with &lt;a href="http://oroeco.com"&gt;Oroeco&lt;/a&gt;
and others on climate and behavior, and generally interested in science with
social impacts, currently focused on &lt;a href="http://statsforchange.com"&gt;Stats for
Change&lt;/a&gt; (a Bay Area hub) and the &lt;a href="http://dssg.io"&gt;Data Science for
Social Good Fellows Program&lt;/a&gt;. I’m also interested in the role of
personal development, ranging from education to “mindful practice” (like
meditation, taiji, the Feldenkrais Method®, and Contact Improv).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This design of this site is meant to support &amp;amp; cross-reference that work!&lt;/p&gt;
