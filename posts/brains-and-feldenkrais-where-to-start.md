I've spent the past 10 years trying to understand the human mind in the light of
the Feldenkrais method. It's hard. But I think the below is a good place to
start.

Quote Feldenkrais on how Esther Thelen was way beyond his understanding of the
science of human development. Moshe died in 1983. Esther kept thinking about
this, and in 1999 published a foundational model for how to think about the
relationship between movement, attention, and goals:

Figure 3 from Smith, et al. (1999)

Linda Smith and Gregor Schoener actually continued thinking about these things,
but I'm a bit behind.
