Contact improv is a dance form that started with some experiments inspired by
Steve Paxton's experience with martial arts. Athletic men would literally throw
themselves at each other and then see what happened. It's hard to find video if
you don't pay for it, but you can find some early recordings of his group,
Magnesium. It looks pretty nuts, and it was - the first participants couldn't
keep up this level of intensity, and they toned things down pretty rapidly after
the first couple of weeks!

From those initial experiments, Contact Improv has become a true folk art - in
the sense that it is an art that is maintained somewhat anarchically by the
community that practices it. There is no culture of critics, an no real audience
to speak of (though some claim it is the “largest” influence on where
contemporary dance has gone in the post-modern era). One particular point of
contention is embodied by Steve Paxton's assertion that dancing Contact Improv
is “dancing physics,” and not (pun intended) “dancing chemistry.”

The debate is an aspirational one at best -- any interaction between two human
bodies will involve both physics and the emotional stuff that comes up.

At some point, I took it upon myself to be one of the people that looks out for
sexual violence in the contact improv community. 

My friend Nick captured it precisely by guessing at my feelings at the
time: I “wanted to rip somebody's balls off.”
