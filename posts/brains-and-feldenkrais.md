I've spent the past 10 years trying to understand the human mind in the light of
the Feldenkrais method. It's hard. But I think the below is a good place to
start.

Quote Feldenkrais on how Esther Thelen was way beyond his understanding of the
science of human development. Moshe died in 1983, and Esther (of course) kept
thinking and deepening her understanding. Of course, the respect went both ways
-- Esther would ultimately enroll in a Feldenkrais Training program (with Mark
Reese?). Following her engagement with that program, and towards the end of her
life, Esther, together with her colleagues proposed the following foundational
model for how to think about the relationship between movement, attention, and
goals:

Figure 3 from Smith, et al. (1999)

For sure get into gold lam√© baby outfits.

Linda Smith and Gregor Schoener actually continued thinking about these things,
but I'm a bit behind.
