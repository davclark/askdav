I'd like to start by saying that Miazake's film “The Wind Rises” (風立ちぬ) has
impacted me more than perhaps any other movie I've ever seen. A good part of
this is that I am the right place to receive it. My experience and response to
it is a bit much for a single essay, so I'm going to focus here on the
persistent social issues that have shaped the distribution strategy for the film.

In short, the film is amazing, and this is a [broadly recognized
fact](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/03/10/the-wind-rises-takes-animation-prize-at-japan-academy-awards).
It's also [offensive to many of my fellow
citizens](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/movies/hayao-miyazakis-film-the-wind-rises-gets-complaints.html).
In short, the film provides a (highly) fictionalized account of the lead
engineer for the Mitsubishi Zero, which has a notorious role in American history
in the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Let me put this another way: Miazake portrayed the humanity of this engineer.
This engineer is, unfortunately a devil in American mythology. You may not have
a clear sense of Japan being the devil. To put a finer point on it, for some,
this is likely comparable to lionizing the engineers of Nazi Germany's war
machines.

I feel that this movie tells the most compelling story I've yet heard about how
the world ended up the way it did in the broadest of brush strokes. The world is
a terribly and wonderful place, and yet strangely, the architects of this world
were fragile humans -- just like you or I -- trying to follow their dreams.

Perhaps I'm biased. My grandma left Nazi Germany with her single mother in
194X(?) wearing a Swastika armband for the duration of her boat trip across the
Atlantic. Growing up, she was the devil -- even in grade school. And my wife is
Japanese, and is perhaps one of the most sensitive and kind people I've known.

I think it's grammatical to say “the Japanese race” or “the German race,” which
makes me suspect that the sentiment that Japanese or German people are (or even
were) the devil is a form of racism. Interestingly, the circumstances that gave
rise (at least in part) to this racism were similar to those forces that
continue to breed racism in the United States today: poverty and unjust legal
frameworks.
