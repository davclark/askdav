Thanks for taking an interest in the materials I presented at ISCS 2014. I'm
excited to collaborate with you!

# The plan

I'll be producing a recorded intervention in the coming week or so, but I still
need to square things aware with our IRB! In the meantime, please sign up on
[the Open Science Framework (OSF) project](https://osf.io/btc5f/), or just email
me at davclark@berkeley.edu to be kept in the loop.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

If this is the first you've heard of the Open Science Framework, it's an effort
in Virginia to build a community platform for open, reproducible, collaborative
science.

You're also welcome to leave a comment below (note - that's only available on
the full post view, you need to click on the title from the index).
