I've spent about a decade now trying to understand embodied approaches to
holistic well-being. In particular, I've found that the Feldenkrais method is
particularly well suited to my investigation that spans rigorous psychology
(including the relevant neuroscience) and human development -- most particularly
my own.

An enormous concern arises, see in particular [this] recent paper on the effects
of mindfulness meditation. The gloss is that it seems in fact to be a modest
cure-all. In other words, mindfulness looks a lot like a placebo. But after many
years of taking pains to explain that approaches like Feldenkrais are best
thought of as education (as compared to thinking of them like a medical
intervention like a pill or surgery), I finally put something together:
conventional education [*also* looks like a placebo].
