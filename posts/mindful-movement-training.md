Lay out connection between predictive impacts of cognitive control in the broad
population and ADHD. This is important for pretty much everyone.

Individuals with a diagnosis of ADHD, however, will more strongly (and thus
clearly) exhibit relevant difficulties. Interestingly, we see motor control
issues here (bring up mirror with elite athletes?).

So, mindful movement training can help maybe everyone, and by understanding
what's going on in the "pathology" of ADHD and effective ways of addressing it,
maybe we come up with interventions that are good for everyone!
