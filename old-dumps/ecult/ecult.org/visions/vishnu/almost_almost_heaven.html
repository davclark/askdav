<div class="newsitemcontent"><p class="p">     The last time I wrote, I was finally on a clear trajectory towards my goals of doing my litte part towards Figuring It All Out.  But, if there's one thing that even a first year student of literary theory could tell you, it would be this: my life never seems to go exactly where it was I thought it was gonna go.<br /><br />So first off, grad school didn't work out.  I had people on the inside at both of my top choice universities certain I would get in.  Some colleagues I told were certain that I was pulling their leg - there's just no way I wouldn't have gotten in.  But it's true.  I lacked clarity of purpose, and universities these days are conservative institutions.  They are not about to jump at the prospect of the neuroscience of fluffy holistic health practices from an ideological, but uncertain visionary.<br /><br />I found this out a few weeks after moving to Frisco from NYU for a  new new job at Stanford.  It was one day after my <a href="http://ecult.org/powwow/kinetonaut/brainstorming" target="_self">announcement</a> of my intention to put together a holistic neuroscience conference in Boston.  I was completely derailed for a few days, but then I did what any rational person in my position would have done - I started working towards a sweet job in Northern Virginia.  Specifically, a job doing R&amp;D for <a href="http://www.entrieva.com" target="_self">Entrieva</a>.  It's hard to tell from their website, but they're attemptig to build a viable alternative to google - or at least parts of it.  I have been wrong about stuff before, but I'm pretty sure this is potentially revolutionizing techology.<br /><br />During this next segment of the adventure, I'm hoping to function as a kind of Idea Entrepreneur.  Given my understanding of academic research, and a small amount of disposable income, I think I can help some pretty cool things happen.  Ultimately, I may be far more productive in this capacity than I would have been as a grad student.<br /><br />I guess we'll find out.<br /><br />Postscript - There are other pieces in the bad New York karma puzzle.  I've managed to alienate two of my closest friends there.  I left behind perhaps the first colleague that I genuinely came to dislike - I assume he dislikes me.  I have unfinished business all over the place.<br /><br />A little over a year ago, I started a <a href="http://ecult.blogspot.com/2004/10/broadway-hard-way-apocolypse.html" target="_self">story</a>.  I came to New York without a job, without a place to live, without any savings to speak of.  It was just me and my closest friend Tom (he in a position not terribly dissimilar to my own) against the fray.  I guess we both managed in our own way.  I certainly wouldn't call it a success story.  But, I wouldn't say it was a failure either.
