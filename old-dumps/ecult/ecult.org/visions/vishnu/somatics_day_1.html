<div class="newsitemcontent"><p class="p"><br />Last Wednesday (January 20, 2010) was the first day of the somatics class at UC Berkeley. Prof. Hackney asked that we keep a journal as we progress through the class, and that seems like a great way for me to generate some content regarding somatics in general. So, here we go!<br /><br />Interestingly, the preponderance of students appear to be nonperformance related majors. This is a big surprise for me. I was expecting it would be difficult for me to get into the class as a graduate student in psychology. But, for example, one of the first people I met was an MBA student. I suspect this will make for an interesting class.<br /><br />Piggy Hackney is indeed a joy to learn from. I feel that one of the hallmarks of a great teacher is that one feels challenged yet prepared to learn the material presented. And I certainly had this experience on day one. Part of what contributed to my appreciation of her teaching was Prof. Hackney's incredible abilities for improvisational movement. She is truly a joy to watch.<br /><br />In the two hours of class, I can't say I &quot;learned&quot; too much. But, I did feel great at the end of class. In the presentation of Laban Movement Analysis, I did find it to be less starkly modern than I expected. We also had an opportunity to observe one another and settle into the dynamics of moving with one another.<br /><br />Lastly, we had homework assignment. We were supposed to do an &quot;opening&quot; and &quot;closing&quot; movements. I can't say I've been very rigorous about this. But I have done it twice. Unsurprisingly, these movements outside of the context of class certainly lacked the effectiveness they had during class. But, it's a great way to check in. Certainly, it's something I have done quite frequently in the past.<br /><br />With that I realize I should say something about what I mean by &quot;effectiveness.&quot; For me, the most central objective of somatic education is an improvement in our understanding of the way we move. Along with that comes a concurrent improvement in our quality of movement. We can become functionally stronger, more flexible and more coordinated. And all of this, of course, feels great!<br /><br />Here's our textbook on Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Connections-Integration-Bartenieff-Fundamentals/dp/9056995928/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264394694&amp;sr=8-1" target="_self">Making Connections</a>. (Note, I have yet to figure out how to make money on such links).<br /></p>
