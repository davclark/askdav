<div class="newsitemcontent"><p class="p">   Only a few days after writing about <a href="http://ecult.org:8080/ecult.org/visions/vishnu/where_it_all_began">where it all began</a>, I ran into the Feldy who's name I was trying to remember.  His name is Keith Johnson, and he was at the Gesundheit! Institute for 8 years or so.  He was pleased to know that his mission of doing some outreach while there at least had an effect on me.  He also remembered us juggling fire while we were there.  Remember that, kids, as much as I like to be a snooty juggler — all about skills and none about flash — people remember the flash.<br /><br />I also happened to run into my first sensei from middle school — Mr. Minkel.<br /><br />These people were both in the same place - the Eastern Regional meeting of the Feldenkrais Guild of North America, of which I am also a member.  I am in good company.<br /><br />Adding to the cavalcade of old acquaintance, James Holland sent me <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cejaZqIovz0" target="_blank">a link to his YouTube music video</a> that he was working on back when I was in Boston.  It pains me to watch it on YouTube, as the special effects are quite sharp as I remember, and now they're all granulated and glitchy.  But, if it weren't for YouTube, maybe I couldn't see it at all.<br /></p>
