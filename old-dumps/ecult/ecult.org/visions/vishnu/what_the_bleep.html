<div class="newsitemcontent"><p class="p">So, I'm busy and not writing anything these days.  But this e-mail hinges on some ideas that are important to me these days.  Maybe I'll clean it up into a proper essay some day...</p>
<p class="p">But probably not.</p>
<p class="p">As for What the Bleep, and so on, I'd say my primary issue with the film is that it was generally very sloppy with how ideas were communicated, and I think in some cases, with the very fabric of those ideas.  Examples:</p>
<p class="p">1) Failure to include, or inclusion of ideas _opposite_ to important holistic observations</p>
<p class="p">The presentation of mind / body issues being reduced to neuro-endocrine chemical transmitters was did little in my mind to help undo the current dualist tendencies in both casual and scientific thinking.  In this case, I think that &quot;serious&quot; holistic health practices as well as careful science have a much cleaner and clearer understanding of the mind / body problem than was communicated.  The cartoon with neurotransmitters or whatever was _way_ long and annoying and (I think) misleading.</p>
<p class="p">How these things should be thought of is in fact a complex issue, and way too involved to discuss fully in an e-mail.  Candice Pert, who was actually in the movie, actually has a decent book on that kind of thing (the molecules of emotion).  Damasio is also good.  Feldenkrais is also good!</p>
<p class="p">In brief, we are a complex of different perceptual, motor and control systems.  These systems are not necessarily distinct in the sense that clear lines can be drawn between them.  Their structure stems from a variety of genetic / evolved factors, as well as environmental / learned factors.  Pleasure, for example, is a useful concept.  It is a state which involves a constellation of coordinated sub-states at every level from the balance of peptides in the blood, to the contraction of specific facial muscles leading to a smile.  All of these things interact with our consciousness, memory and so on in interesting ways - with modulation occurring in both directions.</p>
<p class="p">2) Inclusion of stuff that just doesn't make sense, and serves to discredit the film to all but the hard-core</p>
<p class="p">The quantum physics thing was just completely not based on anything that is currently believed by a significant number of physicists.  I certainly don't know enough to say for sure that you never get a probability distribution of kids on a playground when you turn your back.  BUT, most people who keep up with physics in even the most casual sense will immediately dismiss that kind of thing as patent nonsense.</p>
<p class="p">This is a common feature of out-group art, rallies, etc.  They will serve as rallying points for a community that feels ignored, but at the same time, they tend to alienate people that might be gained as allies, and provide additional fodder to the powers that be.</p>
<p class="p">One can dismiss the entire movie (or anti-globalization movement, etc.) simply because of a few crazy ideas that seem to ignore large quantities of human knowledge and experience.  Just because physicists ignore you doesn't mean you should ignore physicists.</p>
<p class="p">Alright!  That was intense!<br /></p>
