<div class="newsitemcontent"><p class="p">My first clear memory of a discussion of political ribbons was on the Rush Limbaugh television show.  It should be noted that when I was younger, I was more susceptible to the influence of my Dad and his right-wing ways.  That is, I was watching the Rush Limbaugh show on purpose.  And, perhaps even more to the point, I think Rush was fairly on the mark on this issue.</p>
<p class="p">As I remember it, Rush was criticizing the ribbons as an accusation from the left-wing of our country.  They were claiming, in some sense that they cared more than you about AIDS or cancer or whatever else.  In jest, Rush suggested a dollar bill ribbon as a way for right-minded conservatives to express their own superior concern over the national deficit.</p>
<p class="p">Certainly I don't mean here to question the sincerity of all ribbon-wearing folk.  But it seems clear to me that there is at least a sense of resting on a moral high ground, if not an out and out smugness in those that have worn or currently wear some ribbon.  And I don't even mean to suggest that such an attitude is entirely unwarranted.  Our worlds problems are difficult and complex.  The fact that AIDS or the deficit or the War on Iraq exist as problems at all in spite of all our fancy ideas and technologies speaks volumes.  Consider, for example, all of the issues that we have more or less soundly whupped.  We have nearly seamless systems of economic exchange.  We have put humans in outer space.  We can effeciently encode and stream digital video.  And almost no one dies from The Plague anymore.</p>
<p class="p">So we see all these hard problems with no easy solution.  And some of us feel like we at least need to say Something about Something.  And the local store has these ribbons that you can buy for at most a few dollars.  All the profits go to help the cause, right?  You're part of the solution.</p>
<p class="p">Sure it's a bunch of crap.  But so are a lot of things we do.  So what?</p>
<p class="p">The problems seem to creep in when these symbols of concern get associated with an ideology.  And this has happened in a huge way with the flag ribbons.  They are immediately identified with the &quot;right&quot;.  So much so, in fact, that the recent Onion book about dealing with homeland security uses a smiling couple adorned with flag ribbons on its cover.</p>
<p class="p">These ideologies are always in stark opposition to some other ideology.  Said ideology of course comprises approximately 50% of the nation.  And their symbols stand accusing the other half of great Evil.</p>
