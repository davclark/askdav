<div class="newsitemcontent"><img src="http://ecult.org:8080/ecult.org/visions/images/ribbon_on_gate.jpg" width="315" height="375" alt="ribbon_on_gate.jpg" class="float-left" title="" /><p class="p">This story starts with a bit of a lie.  These ideas weren't mine alone, but the other party involved with the brainstorming doesn't want any credit.  So I really haven't any way out.  The way I must now tell the story is like this:</p>
<p class="p">I came up with this great idea.  I was incredibly excited by it right away, but as time went on, my excitement grew and grew.  I believed I had discovered something true, something real.  It was like discovering the structure of a crystal or knowing the mind of God for a brief moment.  The revelation was complete and perfect.</p>
<p class="p">I was going to take some of those magnetic &quot;support our troops&quot; ribbons and slap them on the steel bases of the Gates.  I would tell everyone.  I made flyers and put up a manifesto on my website.  I knew people would see the power of this idea, and it would spread like wildfire.  I imagined thousands of ribbons which would mysteriously appear on the day of the unfurling and disappear just as swiftly the next day.</p>
<p class="p">In fact, responses varied widely.  They ranged from mild and vague support to accusatory invective.  In some rare cases, the response was a mixture of both (I am thinking here of Jeff Stark, who put my announcement on his excellent <a href="http://nonsensenyc.com">list</a> out of principle, despite absolute aesthetic disagreement with the idea).</p>
<p class="p">There were, unfortunately, many practical difficulties.  Like any Mystical experience, it was never possible to explain my vision.  A few people understood immediately, like (of course) Tom.  A few friends of mine who knew a lot about art and a lot about me (or more specifically about what I am not) also seemed to have some understanding.</p>
<p class="p">So, of course, I will try to explain it anyway.  In text, no less.  God help me.  And you.</p>
<p class="p">I've written more completely on the subject of <a href="http://ecult.org:8080/ecult.org/visions/vishnu/support_our_troops">the ribbons</a> elsewhere.  To me they are a perfect example of the forces dividing our country.  I have encountered people who seem to support the idea of the ribbons in large part because they have family overseas.  Others remember (or see now) the difficulty experienced by vets of other wars, like during Vietnam.  Others see them very clearly as an accusation directed at the left, or support of Bush's ideology.</p>
<p class="p">I can make no claims of understanding the totality of American sentiment on any issue.  But I can say that I the views I have experienced can be fairly neatly divided into two groups.  The first group sees the ribbons as a positive thing.  They seem to honestly believe that the troops do indeed need our support.  Moreover, they feel that protesters and their ilk may be undermining the safety and mental well-being of men and women in uniform.  I have encountered no one in this group, however, that agrees that the ribbons are intended as an accusation or a more general ideological stance.  In fact, this group seems largely mystified by anyone that has a strong negative reaction to the ribbons.  Or they assume that such individuals have had the wool pulled over their eyes by the left-wing propaganda machine.</p>
<p class="p">In spite of this, there is a group that perceives the statements made by the ribbons as a direct attack on their beliefs, their values and their way of life.  To these individuals, the ribbons are just another part of a right-wing propaganda machine.  I must admit that I was initially in this latter group.  In fact, for a brief while, I was stealing the ribbons off the backs of cars at rest stops, and I thought that was really fun.  And at first conception, the Gates project was intended to be an expression of the sentiment of this group.</p>
<p class="p">In fact, I didn't expect the responses of the first group to turn out like they did at all.  But I realized that the project was in fact a great opportunity to explore the divisions that seem to exist in our country.</p>
<p class="p">Ultimately, I am unconvinced that it is possible to say definitively how the various propaganda machines of the left and the right have contributed to the phenomena of the ribbons and our various reactions to them.  But it seems entirely clear that something like the current political climate is necessary for such a dramatic split between our perceptions and the actual intentions of our neighbors.</p>
<p class="p">Now, they mostly just make me sad.</p>
<p class="p">So, early on, I had this realization that pursuing this idea about the ribbons led me into an interaction with how people actually felt.  And I had this crazy idea that other people interacting with this idea would lead to them finding out how people actually felt.  One of the beauties of the idea was that it turned out to largely lack intention.  People had a hard time seeing the significance of the act of placing these ribbons.  And so they actually thought a little bit about it.  But at the same time, they attribute this kind of perverse quality to it.  There was a suggestion of mischief directed towards an obviously powerful social symbol.  The problem arose when people would ask me, the originator, what the project meant.  To me, it didn't mean anything.  It was purely meant to provoke the sharing of ideas and feelings.</p>
<p class="p">The very day I posted my first manifesto on my website, I also met Anja, who turns out to be a person that I am able to love very much.  My fervor at the time was nearly sufficient to put her off entirely.  Ideas are dangerous.</p>
<img src="http://ecult.org:8080/ecult.org/visions/images/anja_with_tourists.jpg" width="328" height="348" alt="anja_with_tourists.jpg" class="float-right" title="" /><p class="p">Anja turned out to have a beautiful counterpoint to my own project (documented <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/shrip/shripimage/PhotoAlbum11.html"><br />here</a>).  She would dress all in orange (er, saffron), including a large orange scarf that she'd hold above her head, and wander around the park, being a lost or escaped gate.  She would, like me, tell people different things when they asked her what she was on about.  While it was very clear to Anja, and to some others, that what she was doing was a fine thing, she was never able to articulate her motivations clearly.  And she would complain about this fact - suggesting that she should spend some time to develop the theory behind her performance.  But she never did.</p>
<p class="p">She did, at least, experience continual affirmation of her idea.  But at the same time, she would often remark that people didn't understand what she was doing.</p>
<p class="p">In the end, I think both projects ended up being for ourselves.  We both learned a lot about how other people think.  We would make some people happy, while others would criticize us.  It is only partly right to say that the act itself was the end goal of our project.  The goal wasn't to make people think any particular thing or feel any particular way.  But at the same time, it was a necessary component for our projects to be public ones.  They would not have had meaning for us if others didn't observe them.</p>
<p class="p">There is no way to draw a division between fools, madmen and those who truly speak with God.  Ultimately, I think this is unimportant.  Sometimes you will see or hear a thing and recognize something profound there.  It may change your life or it might just make you smile.  But you should definitely follow up on it!</p>
